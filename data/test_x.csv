3695,Just an average comedic dateflick but not waste of time

3787,Instead of accurately accounting terrible true story the film more determined to become the next Texas Chainsaw Massacre 
3788,It unfortunate that Wallace who wrote Gibson Braveheart as well as the recent Pearl Harbor has such an irrepressible passion for sappy situations and dialogue

3796,Secret Ballot is too contemplative to be really funny 
3797, friends couples miles and all the Pabst Blue Ribbon beer they can drink it the ultimate redneck roadtrip 
3798,It too bad that the rest is nt more compelling 
3799,The movie biggest offense is its complete and utter lack of tension 
3800,A whimsical if predictable timetravel fable marred by willful singlemindedness 
3801,Half of it is composed of snappy patter and pseudosophisticated cultural observations while the remainder would be more at home on daytime television serial

3829,A quiet treasure film to be savored 
3830,The movie succumbs to being nothing more than formulaic chase in the dark

3847,Instead of hyperbolic beatcharged urban western it an unpretentious sociologically pointed slice of life 
3848,Ramsay as in Ratcatcher remains filmmaker with an acid viewpoint and real gift for teasing chilly poetry out of lives and settings that might otherwise seem drab and sordid

3852,It a featurelength adaptation of one of those Can This Marriage Be Saved 
3853,LRB Morgan RRB Judd and Franklin ca nt save the script rooted in novel by Joseph Finder from some opportunism 
3854,This is simply the most fun you ll ever have with documentary

3857,Thurman and Lewis are hilarious throughout 
3858,Borrows from so many literary and cinematic sources that this future world feels absolutely deja vu 
3859,Arguably the best script that Besson has written in years

3866,The film snags and stumblings are more than compensated for by its wryly subversive tone 
3867,just pound away 
3868,Returning aggressively to his formula of dimwitted comedy and even dimmer characters Sandler who also executive produces has made film that makes previous vehicles look smart and sassy 
3869,What Time Is It There 
3870,A combination of standard stiff TVstyle animation and snazzylooking digital effects that do little to disguise the fact that the characters barely move 
3871,While McFarlane animation lifts the film firmly above the level of other comingofage films it also so jarring that it hard to get back into the boys story 
3872,Enduring love but exhausting cinema 
3873,A turgid little history lesson humourless and dull 
3874,Looks and feels like project better suited for the small screen 
3875,On the surface it a loversontherun crime flick but it has lot in common with Piesiewicz and Kieslowski earlier work films like The Double Life of Veronique 
3876,A refreshingly authentic comingofage tale 
3877,Despite the evocative aesthetics evincing the hollow state of modern love life the film never percolates beyond monotonous whine 
3878,Challenging intermittently engrossing and unflaggingly creative 
3879,LRB Davis RRB has bright chipper style that keeps things moving while never quite managing to connect her wishfulfilling characters to the human race 
3880,A resonant tale of racism revenge and retribution 
3881,Not only does the movie fail to make us part of its reality it fails the most basic relevancy test as well 
3882,It does nt flinch from its unsettling prognosis namely that the legacy of war is kind of perpetual pain 
3883,Flounders due to the general sense that no two people working on the production had exactly the same thing in mind 
3884,A giggle minute

3888,Charming and funny LRB but ultimately silly RRB movie 
3889,What begins as seemingly brainless bubbly romantic comedy becomes clichedrenched melodrama by midfilm and by film end feminist action fantasy 
3890,Will probably stay in the shadow of its two older more accessible Qatsi siblings 
3891,Bad beyond belief and ridiculous beyond description 
3892,Frustratingly Dridi tells us nothing about El Gallo other than what emerges through his music 
3893,A simmering psychological drama in which the bursts of sudden violence are all the more startling for the slow buildup that has preceded them 
3894,Sorry Charlie
3895,One scarcely needs the subtitles to enjoy this colorful action farce 
3896,Hilarious musical comedy though stymied by accents thick as mud

3914,The level of maturity displayed by this yearold firsttime feature director is astonishing considering her inexperience and her subject matter 
3915,The story is inspiring ironic and revelatory of just how ridiculous and moneyoriented the record industry really is 
3916,The idea of yearold Roberto Benigni playing the wooden boy Pinocchio is scary enough 
3917,Vera technical prowess ends up selling his film short he smoothes over hard truths even as he uncovers them 
3918, its successes are also tempered with elements which prove the direct antithesis of what it gets right 
3919,So routine familiar and predictable it raises the possibility that it wrote itself as newly automated Final Draft computer program 
3920,This is the kind of movie that used to be right at home at the Saturday matinee and it still is 
3921,The essential problem in Orange County is that having created an unusually vivid set of characters worthy of its strong cast the film flounders when it comes to giving them something to do

3923,Karmen moves like rhythm itself her lips chanting to the beat her long braided hair doing little to wipe away the jeweled beads of sweat 
3924,We never really feel involved with the story as all of its ideas remain just that abstract ideas

3926,Bravo for history rewritten and for the uncompromising knowledge that the highest power of all is the power of love 
3927,The only thing that could possibly make them less interesting than they already are is for them to get full montied into scrappy jovial team

3931,The actors improvise and scream their way around this movie directionless lacking any of the rollicking dark humor so necessary to make this kind of idea work on screen 
3932,I am highly amused by the idea that we have come to point in society where it has been deemed important enough to make film in which someone has to be hired to portray Richard Dawson
