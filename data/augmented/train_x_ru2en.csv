8501,1,Just a collection of both - whatever takes time - without a single whole.
8502,1,"As it stands, ""Crocodile Hunter"" has the hasty, ill-wound look of 1959 ""s"" Godzilla, ""which combines scenes of a Japanese monster flirting with footage of Raymond Burr commenting on the monster's path to destruction."

10875,2,"It is an acting showcase that solves its main task without the use of special effects, but rather by emphasizing the characters, including minor ones."
10876,1,"The characters seem one-dimensional, and the film is superficial and likely to appeal primarily to the target audience."
10877,1,"Extremely boring and cumbersome work, as imperialist as Katzenberg's ""Prince of Egypt"" in 1998."

10908,2,"Whether ""The Layoff"" can attract an American audience is debatable."
10909,2,"Unfortunately, the characters are too weird and dysfunctional, including Tom, to ever get under his skin, but this is largely offset by behind-the-scenes dialogue, visual playfulness, and the absurdity of the idea itself."
