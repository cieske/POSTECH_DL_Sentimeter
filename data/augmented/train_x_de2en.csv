966,1,The main problem with Windtalkers is that most of the film focuses on the wrong character.
967,3,"Oh, and more entertaining, too."
968,1,The bustling urban comedy is clearly not Zhang's forte; his approach to directing is neither light nor magical enough to evoke this kind of whimsy.
969,3,Has a solid emotional impact.
970,4,It is an intoxicating place to visit this laboratory of laughter.

976,4,"It differs from others in its genre in that it does not rely on silly gags, anatomical humor or character clichés; it relies primarily on the character to tell its story."

978,3,"... there is enough originality in ""Life"" to distance it from the pack of romantic comedies that so often land on cinema screens."
979,4,"The year 2002 has spawned more coming-of-age stories than seem possible, but Take Care of My Cat turns out to be the best of them."

1022,1,"All in all, such fanfare is a matter of taste."
1023,3,"Clint Eastwood's Blood Work is like a well-made PB & J sandwich: familiar, relatively uneventful and without any real surprises - but still quite tasty and inviting."

3630,2,"The film has a dark atmosphere, whereby Herrmann quietly suggests the sadness and obsession among Hearst's forced avuncular choruses."

3651,0,Attal is pushing too hard to turn it into a comedy or serious drama.
3652,0,"Having gone through this sloppy comedy special as if made for a movie, I wonder if Lawrence hates criticism so much that he refuses to evaluate his own work."

5102,1,"The final hour of the film, which contains almost all of the previously invisible material, is an unconvincing soap opera that Tornatore has correctly edited."
5103,3,"As the sci-fi movies of the 1950s used to say, Signs is an homage to Shyamalan's gifts, which are such that we will be watching the sky for his next project."

5111,3,"Diaz, Applegate, Blair and Posey are appropriately oblique, which should appeal to women, and they strip off often enough to keep men alert, if not amused."
5112,3,"The usually good-natured nature of Mr. Deeds, with his embrace of sheer kindness and cameos from less-than-likely New York celebrities... certainly elevates the film above anything Sandler has done before."

5143,4,"Without resorting to stock or parody, Haynes - LRB- like Sirk but otherwise -RRB- has transformed the rhetoric of Hollywood melodrama into something provocative, rich and strange."
5144,1,McTiernan's remake may be lighter on its feet - the sober original was as graceful as a tap-dancing rhinoceros - but it's equally dull and obvious.

5150,3,"Poetic, intoxicating documentary."
5151,0,"It is the element of condescension when the filmmakers look down from their high chairs at their working-class subjects that makes Sex With Strangers, which opens today in the New York metropolitan area, so distasteful."
5152,1,"-LRB- Tobacks -RRB- Preference for fancy split screens, stuttering cuts and pompous references to Wittgenstein and Kirkegaard... blends unpleasantly with the tickling material."
5153,0,"For all its insights into the dream world of teenage life and its electronic expression through cyber culture, the film leaves no one cold who wants to draw a coherent story from its 2 1 / 2-hour running time."
5154,2,"Ultimate X is a ride, basically the kind of Greatest Hits role that could come with a subscription to ESPN the Magazine."

5165,3,"This veritable speculation about the assassination of John F. Kennedy in the cinema may have been inspired by Blair Witch, but it takes her techniques into such new territory that the film never feels derivative."
5166,3,"Although it lacks the absolute authority of a genre jewel, this captivating blend of love and bloodletting has a certain robustness."
5167,2,"Sean Penn, you owe Nicolas Cage an apology."

7482,1,"While Hollywood Ending has its share of belly laughs - LRB-, including a knockout of a closing line - RRB-, the film ends up feeling like a big missed opportunity."

7496,0,"Crossroads feels like a teen-bopper Ed Wood movie, full of adolescent scandalous innuendo and lofty but sagging drama."
7497,1,"LRB- Lin Chung's -RRB- voice is quite unusual, even irritating -LRB- at least for this western ear -RRB-, which makes it terribly difficult to buy the impetus for the complicated love triangle that develops between the three central characters."
7498,1,The bustling urban comedy is clearly not Zhang's forte; his approach to directing is neither light nor magical enough to evoke this kind of whimsy.
7499,1,But the film's narrative hook is far too convoluted to be an effective deterrent to guilt.

7595,3,About nine-tenths too clever.
7596,2,A life-size recreation of those Jack Chick cartoons that always ended with some hippie being thrown into the lake of fire.
7597,0,This long and relentlessly sugary film is a clear case of preaching to converts.
7598,2,"Even these stories of just seven children sometimes seem too much, when in reality they are not enough."

7638,2,"Essentially, the film is weak in detail and strong in personality"
7639,1,"Not even Solondz's drive for controversy, sketchy characters, and immature provocations can fully defuse them."
7640,4,Sometimes the film looks really pretty.
7641,3,It succeeds what only a few sequels can accomplish - it matches the original and in some ways even improves it.
7642,2,Maybe it's not a story - but what if it is?

7650,2,But something seems to be missing.

7654,3,"Although Besson's prominent name is Wasabi's big selling point, there is no doubt that Krawczyk deserves a lot of credit for the thoroughly winning tone of the film."

7673,3,"Once you've seen it, you can only love the players it brings to the fore, for the talented but nonsensical people they are, and for the invaluable contribution they have made to our shared history."
7674,1,... the story simply splashes along in search of shrewd observations and leaves empty-handed.
7675,1,"Two big things are missing - anything approaching a visceral kick, and anything approaching a vague reason to sit through it all."
7676,3,It's a solid film about people whose lives are anything but easy.

7684,3,"Birot creates a drama with such a clearly defined sense of place and age - as in, 15 years old - that the torments and fears become almost as operatic for us as they are for her characters."
7685,1,"Hard-core slasher lovers get their money's worth... but overall, the Halloween series has lost its edge."

7688,1,"It's astonishingly bland, despite the high dose of weird performances and directorial instructions."
7689,4,"Fulfilled with Alexandre Desplats haunting and sublime music, the film enchants the audience completely."
7690,4,Fascinating and downright intoxicating.

7706,2,A copy of this film was sent to me for review on DVD.

7709,1,So aggressively cheerful that Pollyana reached for a bag of beef.

7741,0,"The whole thing feels like a ruse, a tactic to disguise the fact that the picture is built around a core of flimsy - or, worse, nonexistent - ideas."
7742,4,Last Orders nourishes the complexity of its characters and allows us to remember that life is ultimately a game of chance and the last orders must be adopted.

8273,4,"His use of the thriller form to explore the labyrinthine ways in which people's lives intersect and change, haunted by events that seem to have gotten out of control, is fascinating, provocative stuff."
8274,1,"This rather unfocused, all-in-one movie would be much better if it reduced its plots and characters to a few rather than dozens... or if it were more subtle... or if it had a sense of humor."
8275,3,"By his modest, straightforward standards, Undisputed scores a bullseye."
8276,2,'Watch out! '
8277,4,"If you're a comic book fan, don't miss it."
8278,1,"For every articulate player like skateboarder Tony Hawk or BMX rider Mat Hoffman, about half a dozen young Turks come to see how often they can incorporate the words ""radical"" or ""suck"" into a sentence."
8279,1,"Maybe LeBlanc thought, ""Hey, the movie about the baseball-playing monkey was worse."""
8280,3,"As the figurehead of an actor, Hart's War has a lot to offer, even if the high-profile Willis is not the most impressive actor."
8281,1,Only masochistic moviegoers have to apply.
8282,0,"The film is so preoccupied with referring to other films and trying to be other films that it lacks heart, mind or humor."
8283,1,Eight-legged freak?
8284,2,"If the very concept makes you nervous... you have an idea of the creepy, scary effectiveness of the film."
8285,1,"There is no spark of new inspiration in it, just more of what has been done with far less energy and imagination."
8286,4,"Beautifully crafted, captivating films designed to attract a discerning, quality-hungry audience, and a nostalgic twisted yarn that puzzles them."
8287,3,K-19: The Widow Maker is a great yarn.
8288,4,Children should have a rousing time in this beautifully drawn film.
8289,3,"It's testament to De Niro and director Michael Caton-Jones that at the end of the film we accept the characters and the film, the mistakes and everything."
8290,2,"Once again we enter the bizarre realm in which director Adrian Lyne calls the shots, in which all relationships are simultaneously widely metaphorical, strangely abstract and painfully literal."
8291,1,"This latest installment of the horror film franchise, seemingly as invulnerable as its trademark villain, has arrived for an incongruous summer playoff, proving once again that the era of smart, well-made B-movies is long gone."
8292,2,... a preachy parable stylized with a touch of John Woo Ball ballet.
8293,1,"Director Shekhar Kapur and screenwriters Michael Schiffer and Hossein Amini tried to modernize and reconceptualize things, but the barriers ultimately proved too great."
8294,0,"... after 9 / 11, ""The Sum of All Fears"" appears stickier and more reprehensible, manipulating our collective fear without giving the subject the intelligence or sincerity it undoubtedly deserves."
8295,3,An amused indictment of Jaglom's own profession.
8296,3,Fans of Chris Fuhrman's posthumous cult novel will probably like the gentle comic treatment of adolescent storm and urge.
8297,3,"It's hard to brag about a flick with all those real cackles, but Notorious C.H.O. still feels like a promising work-in-progress."
8298,1,"The film doesn't think much of its characters, its protagonist or us."
8299,1,Its inevitable absurdities amount to an insult to the intelligence of anyone who has not lived under a rock since 9 / 11 - LRB-.
8300,3,But it's entertaining at a lower level.
8301,4,"In some films flamboyant and in others artfully restrained, 65-year-old Jack Nicholson, with his twelfth Oscar nomination, could prove that he chooses his roles with the precision of an actuary more than ever."
8302,2,"John Carlen's script is full of hapless, two-dimensional characters who are anything but convincing."
8303,4,"If you're a comic book fan, don't miss it."
8304,1,"What Jackson has done is proven that there is no amount of fantasy, no creature, no fantasy story and no unbelievably fancy scenery."
8305,3,"The Four Feathers has rewards, from the exoticism of its sandy seas to the grim grandeur of its rousing battle scenes."
8306,1,"As in most of Jaglom's films, some of it is honestly touching, but much of it seems invented and second-hand."
8307,2,"The film tries to be ethereal, but in the end it seems goofy."
8308,3,"Alternately imaginative, creepy and ravishingly funny."
8309,2,"Like Mike is a harmlessly naive piece of B-ball fantasy, appropriate for the off-season of the real NBA."
8310,3,"""Alice's Adventure Through the Looking Glass and Zombie Land"" is full of strange and wonderful creatures."
8311,0,"The allure of vulgar, sexist, racist humour went over my head or, given how low my forehead is, perhaps it crept under my feet."
8312,4,"It's a beautiful film, full of elaborate and twisted characters - and quite funny, too."
8313,0,"Once the expectation of laughter is suppressed by some obscenity, even the funniest idea is no longer funny."
8314,1,"This toothless dog, which is already attached to the cable, loses all bite on the big screen."
8315,4,A strong performance from Mel Gibson and a brutal 90-minute fight sequence that does everything but a dog tag and an M-16.
8316,3,"If you like splatter movies, you'll probably have a reasonably good time with The Salton Sea."
8317,4,"300 years of Russian history and culture compressed into a fleeting, seamless and lush stream of consciousness."
8318,3,"The film is meant to be funny, uplifting and moving, sometimes at once."
8319,0,Deeply pathetic
8320,2,"The story is well told, and the characters will not disappoint anyone who appreciates the original comics."
8321,3,"Metaphors abound, but it's easy to take this film at face value and enjoy its slightly humorous and tender story."
8322,3,"J. Lo will earn her share of the holiday box office, though this film makes one thing very clear: She's a pretty woman, but she's not a working girl."
8323,3,"An alluring stimulus to the optical nerves, so much so that it is forgivable that the plot feels like any other story of a totalitarian morning."
8324,1,Shunji Iwai's All About Lily Chou Chou is a beautifully shot but ultimately flawed film about growing up in Japan.
8325,1,A catastrophe of a drama that could only be saved by his winged attackers.
8326,1,"The film too often descends into sweetness, holding back the glowing pyrotechnics that its punchy style promises."
8327,2,"An ambitious, serious film that succeeds in doing just about everything wrong; sitting through it is something of an act of cinematic penance."
8328,0,"Failed to make this character comprehensible, to get under his skin, to explore the motivation... Long before the end, the film becomes as boring as its characters, whose fate is difficult to care about."
8329,1,The filmmakers needed more emphasis on storytelling and less on the glamorous machine that plunges audiences into a future they don't care about.
8330,0,A terrible film that will satisfy only the most emotional film-goers.
8331,1,With minimal imagination you could recreate the whole thing in the bathtub.
8332,1,"Its simplicity puts an exclamation mark on the fact that this is not to be taken seriously, but it also destroys any chance that the film will grow beyond similar fare."
8333,2,But it doesn't need Gangs of New York.
8334,0,"A film that is more prescribed than recommended - as visually bland as a dentist's waiting room, with soothing muzak and a cushion of predictable narrative rhythms."
8335,0,"As playful as the film tries to make sense of its title character, there remains a huge gap between the creepy, neatly cut Dahmer - LRB- Jeremy Renner - RRB- and devilish plots that no serious textbook psychology can bridge."
8336,1,"Nohe has made a decent documentary, but he feels like a spectator, not a participant."
8337,3,The beauty of the play is that it's heart as important as humour.
8338,4,"Beautifully shot, sensitively cast and driven by a series of heartfelt performances, it's a lyrical endeavour."
8339,2,"It's not what you see, it's what you think you see."
8340,4,A conventional but heart-warming tale.
8341,4,Sex with strangers is fascinating...
8342,4,"It is all put together with energy, intelligence and verve, reinforced by an abundance of archival material."
8343,1,"Laconic and very reserved in its dialogue, this indie flick never found its audience, probably because it is extremely difficult to identify with any of the characters."
8344,1,That alone is not very interesting.
8345,2,"There is a neat twist, subtly rendered, that could have finished it in 80 minutes, but Kang is banking on three or four more ends."
8346,2,"I am happy to have seen it - not as an alternative version, but as the ultimate exercise in viewing deleted scenes."
8347,2,"The whole film has a condensed feel, but what is available is endearing and lovable."
8348,4,"Although in some ways it resembles Catherine Breilat's ""Fat Girl,"" Rain is the far superior film."
8349,2,"Ice Age is the first computer-generated animated film that feels like other movies, and that makes for a certain ice age early on."
8350,2,"-LRB- Crystal and De Niro -RRB- manage to squeeze out some good laughs, but not enough to make this silly impostor sing."
8351,2,We have an actor who enjoys appearing in a film that is only slightly distracting.
8352,1,"It's so boring you have to forgive every false, dishonest, entertaining and ultimately empathetic moment in Bridget Jones's Diary."
8353,3,"A wildly unpredictable drama with sequences that make you wince with embarrassment and others that, thanks to the actors, are very touching."
8354,2,"It is a testimony of silent perseverance, shared compassion, reconciled survival."
8355,3,"Often likeable, but just as often meandering, low-energy and too eager to be quirky in moments when a little old-fashioned storytelling would be useful."
8356,1,"But Windtalkers doesn't beat this one, either."
8357,2,"Some are fascinating, some are not, and in the end it's almost a good film."
8358,0,"It's not the first time director Sara Sugarman has dropped her pants for laughter, and it's not the last time she hasn't provoked."
8359,1,"Statham uses an accent that I think is an attempt to bully Americans, but sometimes he just lapses into overtly British."
8360,1,"The acting is fine, but there is not enough substance to sustain interest for the full 90 minutes, especially when the chances are slim."
8361,4,"This strange, poetic road movie, peppered with convulsions of pop music, plays pretty much into Morton's ever-vigilant gaze - and it is a tribute to the actress and her inventive director that the journey is so fascinating."
8362,4,An effortlessly accomplished and sonorous work.
8363,0,"Ballistic: Ecks Vs. Sever is not only one of the worst titles in recent film history, but is also characterized by terrible, banal dialogue, comfortable, holey plot, superficial characters and a rather boring, unimaginative car chase."
8364,1,"Solondz may be convinced that he has something significant to say, but he doesn't speak a conversation that appeals to me."
8365,0,The script resorts to too many tried-and-tested tricks that hardly distinguish it from the next teen comedy.
8366,1,"The ethos of the Chelsea Hotel may shape Hawke's artistic ambitions, but he hasn't yet matched his own DV poetry with the beat he hears in his soul."
8367,3,"Director Mark Pellington does a terrific job conjuring up a sombre, menacing atmosphere, though the story, alas, only gives us flashing red lights, a rattling noise and a bump on the head."
8368,2,"You don't laugh for an hour and a half, but you come out with a strangely dissatisfied feeling."
8369,3,"The Powerpuff Girls come to the screen with their super powers, their super-simple animations and their super-dooper admiration."
8370,3,Damon brings the right conviction to his role as -LRB- Jason Bourne -RRB-.
8371,1,The screenwriters are no less a threat to society than the film's characters.
8372,3,The scale of his success is impressive.
8373,3,"The film is clever, offbeat and even snappy enough to overcome my resistance."
8374,1,A complete waste of time.
8375,1,The whole thing plays like a tired Tyco commercial.
8376,3,Really disturbing.
8377,3,"Nicks refuses to see Slackers as just another teen movie, meaning he can be forgiven for frequently pandering to fans of the crude comedy."
8378,0,Hollywood Ending is the most disappointing Woody Allen film of all time.
8379,1,Faul directed by Charles Stone III... based on a leaden screenplay by Matthew Cirulnick and novelist Thulani Davis.
8380,3,The remarkable thing about Jolie's appearance is that she never lets her figure become a caricature - not even with that radioactive hair.
8381,0,What an embarrassment.
8382,1,"Starts off peppy and stylish, but doesn't keep pace and solidifies into clichés."
8383,1,A film that doesn't get enough distance from Leroy's delusions to escape their influence.
8384,4,"... lots of warmth, with music and laughter and the love of family."
8385,1,"Feels aimless for much of the film, until late in the film a tidal wave of action sets in that leaves questions."
8386,0,"It is hard to imagine anyone who has reached puberty actually finding the characters in Slackers or their antics amusing, let alone funny."
8387,1,The story itself is actually pretty meaningless.
8388,3,"The costume drama, with its subtitle, is set in a remote African empire in front of mobile phones, guns and the internal combustion engine, but the politics it whips through are as contemporary as tomorrow."
8389,4,"His gentle, touching story creeps into his heart."
8390,1,"Claims to be a Hollywood satire, but ends up being the kind of film that should be the target of something deeper and more engaging."
8391,0,"For most films, 84 minutes is short, but this one feels like a life sentence."
8392,1,"If routine actions and jokes like this are your cup of tea, then pay your $8 and get ready for the big scissors."
8393,3,"Henry Bean's thoughtful screenplay provides no easy answers, but offers a compelling exploration of faith versus intellect"
8394,2,A fascinating but tenacious documentary.
8395,0,A less thrilling thriller.
8396,2,Can seriously affect your ability to ever keep a straight face again while talking to a highway cop.
8397,3,"By not averting his eyes, Solondz forces us to consider the unthinkable, the unacceptable, the unspeakable."
8398,0,The crap goes on.
8399,0,"After you have laughed once -LRB- perhaps twice -RRB-, you will have completely forgotten the movie by the time you return to your car in the parking lot."
8400,1,Fail to convince the audience that these brats will ever be more than losers.
8401,1,"Sounds like Arnold Schwarzenegger, with a physique that matches that - LRB- Ahola -RRB- has a wooden delivery and encounters a substantial arc of change that does not produce any real transformation."
8402,0,"Apart from a few grotesque comedies I tried to forget, this is the first film in a long time that made me go to the theatre in the first 10 minutes."
8403,2,This new time machine is far from perfect... and yet it turns out to be surprisingly useful.
8404,2,Big time.
8405,2,"It remains to be seen whether Statham can move beyond the action genre of crime fiction, but who says?"
8406,3,an original and highly cerebral examination of the psychopathic mind
8407,4,"It may not be real, but it's the laughs."
8408,4,"The intimate cinematography and glowing performances of the film draw us deep into the confusion and pain of the girls, who tragically struggle to grasp the gulf that has opened up between them."
8409,3,"A hypnotic portrait of this sad, compulsive life."
8410,1,A soap opera quality twist in the last 20 minutes... almost puts the stamp on the otherwise lavish work of B-movie fantasy.
8411,4,"What could easily have become a cold, calculated exercise in postmodern pastiche becomes a powerful and deeply moving example of melodramatic film production."
8412,4,"Because the film deliberately lacks irony, it has a real dramatic effect; it plays like a powerful 1957 drama that we've somehow never seen before."
8413,1,David Spade as Citizen Kane?
8414,1,This dubious product of a college-mad LRB-Colgate U.-RRB comedy ensemble known as Broken Lizard plays like a mixture of Cheech and Chong and CHiPs.
8415,2,"By and large, this is a film that does it by the numbers."
8416,0,is much less charming than listening to a four-year-old with a penchant for exaggeration recounting his Halloween trip to the haunted house.
8417,2,Heaven is a haunting dramatisation of a couple's moral ascent.
8418,2,Gone are the flamboyant mannerisms that are the hallmark of some of his performances.
8419,1,The film is flat.
8420,4,"Smart, funny and simply honest enough to offer the pleasures of a slightly cheeky, above-average off-Broadway play."
8421,4,A captivating portrait of a man whose engaging manner and flamboyant style made him a larger-than-life figure.
8422,4,Piccoli gives an excellent performance full of deep feelings.
8423,0,"-LRB- N -RRB- no matter how much goodwill the actors generate, Showtime eventually folds under its own thin skin."
8424,1,"Time of Favor could have set the time of day for the audience by focusing on the elements of apparent alienation within a culture of people who, unfortunately, are hostile to each other through ruthlessness and retribution."
8425,2,Do you know you'd spend ten dollars on a ticket?
8426,0,"A frustrating ""tweener"" - too smooth, invented and exploitative for art houses and too cynical, small and decadent for shopping malls."
8427,0,The only entertainment you can draw from this choppy and sloppy affair is unintentional giggles - several of them.
8428,2,Gibney and Jarecki just want to tie the bastard up.
8429,3,And we do not close our eyes for a moment.
8430,2,"A fantastic premise anchors this film, but what it needs is either a more rigid commitment to its Blair-Witch-style mockumentary format, or a more direct, dramatic treatment, with all the grandeur that implies."
8431,0,"Offers no new insights into matter, and its characters don't exactly come to life either."
8432,4,I can well imagine Benigni's Pinocchio becoming a permanent fixture.
8433,2,"Really stupid, but sometimes really funny."
8434,4,"This is an extraordinary film, not least because it is Japanese and yet feels universal."
8435,4,"The Emperor's Club, ruthless in its own peaceful way, finds one of our most conservative and ugly traditions of filmmaking and gives it a new structure, new relevance, new reality."
8436,3,There is something to be said for a studio-produced film that never bothers to hand over a suitcase full of simple answers to the audience.
8437,1,Why so?
8438,4,Director Charles Stone III applies more detail to the film's music than to the plot; the best thing about Drumline is its energy.
8439,4,This is one of the outstanding thrillers of recent years.
8440,2,Hollywood's answer to a balloon.
8441,1,"The new film of Anton Chekhov's ""The Cherry Orchard"" puts the < unk > ick in < unk > classics. """
8442,3,"Shiri is an action film that promises suspense, but also has a strong dramatic and emotional pull that gradually spreads to the audience."
8443,2,"-LRB- Javier Bardem is -RRB- one of the few reasons to see the film, which director Gerardo Vera has immersed in heady music and feverish melodrama."
8444,2,A bleak indulgence.
8445,3,"Yes, as good as you remember."
8446,3,"It has a caffeinated, sloppy brilliance, bursting with ideas that you wish had been more carefully developed, but enlivened by an energy that shames the dutiful efforts of more disciplined school leavers."
8447,2,A romance?
8448,2,"Last Dance, despite its shortcomings, fulfils one facet of its mission by getting me to find out if this is true in this case."
8449,3,"The unexplored plot possibilities of ""Punch-Drunk Love"" may have worked against the maker's minimalist intent, but it's an interesting exercise by the talented writer-director Anderson."
8450,1,"Stephen Earnhart's documentary is a disintegration of healthy eccentric inspiration and ambition - in the guise of an unsentimental, straight-forward text - if it is really an exercise in crude romanticisation of delusional personality type."
8451,1,Has lost some of the dramatic conviction that underpins the best comedies...
8452,3,"It's very beavis and butthead, but always seems to raise a smile."
8453,3,"By not averting his eyes, Solondz forces us to consider the unthinkable, the unacceptable, the unspeakable."
8454,1,But it wasn't.
8455,0,Rarely has on-screen sex been so aggressively antierotic.
8456,4,"It's nothing we haven't seen from Murphy yet, but I Spy is still funny and entertaining and so aggressively silly that it's more than worth it."
8457,3,"The case for good education and good teachers are more valuable in the way they help to raise the self-esteem of the average student, and not just in terms of the knowledge they impart."
8458,1,"Seriously, rent the Disney version."
8459,3,"Even if you don't know the band or the songs on the album by heart, you'll enjoy seeing them both evolve, and you'll also learn a lot about the state of the music business in the 21st century."
8460,3,"Cherish doesn't quite survive his tonal shift from dark comedy to suspense thriller, but has just enough charm and appealing character traits to forgive this still serious problem."
8461,3,This submarine drama deserves the right to be compared to The Boat.
8462,2,A dense and thoughtful space full of ideas that are too complex to be absorbed quickly.
8463,3,"If you're in the right B-movie mood, it can just let your pants down."
8464,3,"Light up a subject that few are familiar with, and make you interested in music that you may never have heard before."
8465,1,The pool drowned me in boredom.
8466,1,"It gets really funny, if not particularly scary: the film is all about the story, not the content."
8467,3,"A ghastly film that looks, sounds and feels more like an extended, open poem than a traditionally structured story."
8468,0,"The only thing you have to fear with ""Fear Dot Com"" is that you fall asleep on the cinema chair in front of you when you doze off for thirty minutes in the film."
8469,3,"Juliette Binoche's Sand is spirited, but behind her childish smile it is hard to imagine this powerhouse of 19th-century prose."
8470,0,"Mr. Deeds is not really a movie, but a loose collection of less funny gags, occasional moments of lazy humor."
8471,4,"It's one of those rare films that feels like it wasn't written for anyone, but somehow manages to convince almost everyone that it was just for them."
8472,2,The heart of the filmmaker is in the right place...
8473,3,Bring tissues.
8474,3,"There is undeniable fun in films that are stuffed with film references, but the fun is exhausted - then it is over - when nothing else happens."
8475,4,An extraordinary dramatic experience.
8476,1,"True to its title, it captivates viewers in a series of relentlessly nasty situations that we wouldn't consider for a sizeable ransom."
8477,1,"Will be the last thing you would expect from a film with this title, or even from a Plympton film: boring."
8478,2,Red Dragon makes you appreciate the silence of the lambs.
8479,4,"With an obvious connection to her actors and a striking style behind the camera, Hélène Angel is definitely a director to watch."
8480,1,"Coal is no longer as easy to obtain as it used to be, and that would be a worthy substitute for naughty children's stockings."
8481,2,It depends on the history of each child.
8482,1,"The problem with The Bread, My Sweet is that it's far too sentimental."
8483,2,A little objectivity could have made a big difference.
8484,3,"It's OK for a film to be something of a sitcom if the lines work, the humour makes sense and the actors are humanly engaged."
8485,3,While the frequent allusions to gurus and doshas will appear to some Westerners as bordering on gibberish... broad strands of common sense emerge with irrefutable clarity.
8486,1,Ostensibly authentic account of a historical event that is far too tragic to merit such superficial treatment.
8487,1,His screenplay serves as auto-criticism and his clumsiness as his own withering censorship.
8488,1,"Too much power, too little breath."
8489,1,"How he escaped from the Lifetime Network, I will never know."
8490,1,"What is certain is that if George Romero had directed, it would not have taken the protagonists a whole hour to realize that you have to shoot a zombie in the head to kill him."
8491,3,"A college story that works without vulgarity, sex scenes and kissing!"
8492,3,It's an entertaining hour and a half for the family audience.
8493,1,"You can drive right past it without noticing anything special, except for a few odd curves, intentional or not."
8494,1,"Theoretically, the pairing sounds promising... but their lack of chemistry makes Eddie Murphy and Robert DeNiro look like old, familiar variety partners on Showtime."
8495,1,"An OUTLOOK sign, then."
8496,1,... better described as a ghost story that went fundamentally wrong.
8497,1,"Steve Oedekerk, alas, is no Woody Allen."
8498,4,Rarely have I seen a film so ready to stand up for the fallibility of the human heart.
8499,2,"Although Haynes's style is reminiscent of films from that era, his message is not rooted in that decade."
8500,1,It begins wittily and cleverly and you want to love it - but filmmaker Yvan Attal quickly puts himself in a corner.
8501,1,Just an accumulation of this and that -- whatever fills the time -- without a unified whole.
8502,1,"As it stands, Crocodile Hunter has the hasty, poorly cobbled look of the 1959 Godzilla, combining scenes from a Japanese monster movie with footage by Raymond Burr commenting on the monster's path to destruction."
8503,2,"Serious, but ponderous."
8504,3,A sparing but quietly effective retelling.
8505,3,"As relationships shift, director Robert J. Siegel allows the characters to inhabit their world without clinging to a narrative arc."

8507,4,"Production design, score and choreography are simply thrilling."
8508,0,Dramatically lacklustre.

8510,3,"The work of an exhausted, dried-up talent who can't get out of his way."
8511,3,"A live-action cartoon, a fast-paced and merrily simplistic 88-minute exaggerated plot, assembled with the pre-pubescent boy in mind."
8512,1,It lacks drama and depth.
8513,3,"When people started hanging out at the hairdresser, they never wanted to leave."
8514,3,A charming but light comedy.
8515,2,But you'd never guess that from the performances.
8516,4,The actors are just too good and the story too fascinating for technical errors to stand in their way.
8517,3,The gags are often a stitch.
8518,0,The story is spurious and its characters wafer thin.
8519,3,Munch's script observes his characters tenderly.

8523,3,"Muccino seems to explore the idea of why people yearn for what they don't have, and how that gets us into trouble."
8524,3,An older cad teaches a younger lad Zen and the art of lying down in this prickly indie comedy of manners and misanthropy.
8525,0,"Like a bad exercise in improvisation, the superficially written characters laboriously navigate their lives, their love and the art they struggle to create."
8526,4,"Jagger, Stoppard and director Michael Apted... deliver a rousing and surprisingly romantic ride."
8527,3,"Indeed, the more outrageous bits reach a shock-to-laughter intensity of almost Dadaist proportions."
8528,2,"I've seen Juwanna Mann, so you don't have to."
8529,3,"With an unusual protagonist - LRB- a kilt-wearing Jackson - RRB- and fabric, the unlikely ""Formula 51"" is somewhat entertaining, but it could have been much stronger."

8541,1,"It has a typically jovial atmosphere, but a lack of flimsy inventiveness."
8542,3,"Quaid is utterly fearless as a tortured husband living a painful lie, and Moore plays the long-suffering heroine wonderfully with an unshakeable Fifties dignity somewhere between Jane Wyman and June Cleaver."
8543,4,Much of All About Lily Chou-Chou is mesmerizing: some of its plainness could make you cry.
8544,2,"An easy and obvious effort, even for one whose demographic target is probably still in the single digits."
8545,0,"It could have been something special, but two things lead to mediocrity - director Clare Peploe's misunderstanding of Marivaux's rhythms and Mira Sorvino's limitations as a classical actress."

8558,1,"Instead of real figures, Elling and Kjell Bjarne become symbolic figures whose actions are meant to say something about the naive's encounter with the world."
8559,2,"Personal Velocity has a straightforward docu-dogma simplicity, but Miller lingers on invisible, almost psychic nuances, jumping into digressions of memory and desire."

8563,3,"Reminiscent of the style and flashing of the double cross that made Mamet's ""House of Games"" and ""Heist"" so much fun last fall."
8564,1,The film generates action points with a degree of randomness that is normally only achieved through lottery drawing.
8565,1,"The gifted Crudup has the perfect face to play a handsome empty place of longing for himself, and his coded personality and bad behavior would fit well if the film knew what to do with him."

8569,3,"Shyamalan offers an abundance of clues along the way - innumerable signs, if you will - that beneath the familiar, funny surface there is a much bigger, much more significant story than one in which little green men come to earth for harvest."

8581,3,Nicely filmed and well acted... but admittedly problematic in its narrative specifics.
8582,3,"Although mainstream American films tend to exploit the familiar, from time to time a film comes from the fringes, giving the viewer the chance to learn, to grow, to travel."

8613,1,There's no point debunking Byatt's plot for bland Hollywood romances.
8614,3,"Yes, steep upwards."

8616,1,"Even as the hero of the story rediscovers his passion in life, the mood remains strangely detached."
8617,4,"The increasingly diverse French director has created a film that can honestly be described as looking, sounding and simple like no other film in recent history."
8618,3,Steadfast but powerfully dramatic.
8619,2,What amazes me is the lack of emphasis on music in Britney Spears' first film.
8620,2,"It's so silly that you wouldn't be surprised if BA, Murdock and the rest of the A-team were seen in a black and red van following the chase."
8621,2,Snipes relies too much on a dramatically staged scenario to his own advantage.

8628,1,"A considerably less effort, which will pay off better on the cable, especially in view of the short playing time of one hour."

8630,3,"I enjoyed the film in a superficial way, while I was never sure what its purpose was."
8631,1,"And that is, in a sense, an obligation."

8636,2,"Sometimes THE GUYS tap into powerful emotions, but this kind of material is more effective on stage."
8637,4,"The characters are complex and quirky, but absolutely believable as they are brought to life by the ensemble's remarkable cast."

8663,0,"Going forward, one hopes that Mr. Plympton will find room for another member of his small band, a professional screenwriter."
8664,2,"Although the film never strays from its comic course, its unintended parallels could unintentionally evoke memories and emotions that are anything but humorous."
8665,4,"The masterful screenplay is by John Pogue, the Yale author who previously gave us ""The Skulls"" and last year's ""Rollerball."" """
8666,3,But it has a saving grace.

8676,1,"A few swipes aside, the writing is indifferent, and Jordan Brady's direction is prosaic."
8677,1,"It will undoubtedly play well in European markets, where Mr Besson is a brand name, and in Asia, where Mrs Shu is an institution, but the American public will probably find it familiar and insufficiently cathartic."
8678,4,"A taut, sobering film."
8679,3,"It's pretty solid -- not to mention well edited, so it certainly doesn't feel like a movie that crosses the two-and-a-half mark."
8680,1,"Like Bartleby, the film is a bit stiff - an extra-dry office comedy that seems twice as long as its 83 minutes."
8681,3,"What ""Empire"" lacks in depth, it makes up for with the heart."

8683,2,A boring parable about honesty and good sportsmanship.

8690,3,"The film's messages about tolerance and diversity are not particularly original, but you can't help but get carried away by the likeable characters."
8691,1,"Begins with enormous promises and introduces a fascinating and seductive premise, only to fall victim to a shipload of script clichés that sink it faster than a leaky freighter."

8694,1,... contains very few laughs and even fewer surprises.
8695,0,"... a sour little film at its core; an exploration of the emptiness that underpinned the relentless cheerfulness of the 1920s... The end of the film has a ""What was it all for?"""

8781,2,"About Amy's cuteness, Amy's career success - LRB - she's a best-selling author of self-help books that can't help themselves - RRB - and Amy's neuroses when it comes to men."

8783,2,"Hilarious musical comedy, albeit with accents as thick as mud."
8784,2,"Though melodramatic and predictable, this romantic comedy explores the friendship between five Filipino Americans and their desperate efforts to find love."

9579,3,This is a smart and effective film by a director who knows how to create and sustain a mood.
9580,4,"The fascinating details of the film can all be found in the performances, from Foreman's barking-mad Taylor to Thewlis's gently sinister Freddie and Bettany McDowell's dogged gangster."
9581,4,"A thoroughly engaging, surprisingly touching British comedy."
9582,3,"Paid in full is remarkably engaging, though it is clearly derived from Goodfellas and at least half a dozen other problems in the ghetto."
9583,2,"Director Kevin Bray excels at breaking glass and staking out the checklist of ""Miami Vice"" with motorboats, Latin music and dog tracks."
9584,0,"I will not begin to tell you how laborious, how resolutely unfunny, how thoroughly unrewarding all this is, and what a ruthless waste of four fine acting talents..."
9585,1,"The filmmakers play with the big boys in New York and L.A. To that end, they mock the kind of people they don't understand, who they think are the power people, who don't care to understand them."
9586,1,"Such a fine idea for a film and such a stunning, lifeless execution."
9587,3,"The film sounds like the stuff of lurid melodrama, but what makes it interesting as a character study is the fact that the story is told from Paul's perspective."
9588,3,The difference between Cho and most comics is that her confidence in her material is earned.
9589,3,A moving and weighty depiction of the healing attempts of a family after the death of a child.
9590,1,"For the vast majority of casual film-goers, it will probably be a talkative boredom."
9591,1,Just another generic drama that has nothing to offer but its exploitative palette of obligatory cheap thrills.
9592,0,How Nettelbeck sees working women - or at least this working woman - for whom she shows little sympathy is an imposition.
9593,3,"Polanski is in his element here: alone, abandoned, but still comforted by his art, which is more than he has ever revealed about the source of his spiritual survival."
9594,4,That the real Antwone Fisher was able to overcome his personal obstacles and become a good man is a wonderful thing; that he was able to share his story so convincingly with us is a small miracle.
9595,2,-LRB- Garbus -RRB- rejects the potential for pathological studies and instead exhumes the distorted melodrama of the circumstantial situation.
9596,1,"Alternative medicine has its merits, of course... but Ayurveda does the field no favours."

9601,4,"Funny, sexy, devastating and incurably romantic."
9602,2,"Colourful and deceptively sweeping until it suddenly pulls the rug out from under your feet, the reworking of a folk story by the Burkinabe filmmaker Dani Kouyate, whose roots go back to oral traditions of the 7th century, is also a pointed political allegory."
9603,1,A mimetic approach to better films like Contempt and 8 1 / 2.
9604,3,"The film is full of humorous observations about the general absurdity of modern life as seen through the eyes of outsiders, but it cleverly manages to avoid many of the condescending stereotypes that so often plague films about the mentally ill."

9613,1,It's the action scenes where things fall apart.
9614,4,"Funny, dark, absurd and ultimately painfully sad, Bartleby is a fine, subliminal piece of filmmaking."
9615,4,"Rich in dark metaphors and sharp as a samurai sword, Jiang Wen's Devils on the Doorstep is a war farce in the alternately comic and heartbreaking style of Joseph Heller or Kurt Vonnegut."

9619,1,I wanted more.
9620,3,"Ash Wednesday is not Edward Burns's best film, but it is a good and ambitious film."
9621,1,"Apart from theological issues, the film is so clumsily sentimental and clumsily staged that one can speak in tongues."

9632,1,"Paul Bettany is good at being the ultra-violent wannabe gangster, but the film is certainly not number one."
9633,1,"Although there are entertaining and daring moments, the film's ferocious tone and extremely flat lead do little to salvage this filmmaker's battered reputation."
9634,2,One just waits grimly for the next shock without developing much attachment to the characters.

9644,3,"Like Mike, no box office money will make Michael Jordan jealous, but it has some sweet moments, funny scenes and hits the target audience - LRB- young Bow Wow fans -RRB- with nothing but net."
9645,1,is an unspeakable wannabe in search of just that niche.
9646,4,"What makes this silly, outrageous, brilliant thriller so much fun is the talent of the director."
9647,1,"""Synthetic"" is the best description of this well-meaning, beautifully produced film, which sacrifices its promise to a star-studded cast."
9648,3,"It is up to -LRB- Watts -RRB- to lend credibility to this strange scenario, and their presence manages to make us believe."
9649,1,The film adds nothing fresh to the myth.
9650,2,"Soderbergh seems only able to do artfully illuminated, serious research that lacks the kind of real depth that would make it redeemable."

9656,0,"If you are over 25, have an IQ of over 90 and have a driving licence, you'd better be entertained."
9657,2,"If Borstal Boy isn't particularly realistic, it's a compelling nostalgia piece."
9658,3,"Hatfield and Hicks are the strangest of couples, and in this sense the film becomes a study of the gambling of the publishing world and offers a case study that goes beyond the political implications of the film."

9660,2,"The limited backdrops and small, cramped and dark rooms are also a tribute to a classic low-budget film noir."
9661,3,Combine the paranoid claustrophobia of a submarine movie with the unsettling creepiness of the supernatural - why didn't Hollywood think of it earlier?
9662,1,"Sheridan had a wonderful account from which to work, but strangely he dilutes it, turning grit and vulnerability into easy reading."
9663,2,It says a lot about a filmmaker that he can be crazy without blowing the audience over and still maintain a sense of urgency and excitement.
9664,0,"A film in which two not very captivating characters are involved in a romance, the end of which you can hardly expect."
9665,3,"Looking at this gentle, mesmerizing portrait of a man coming to terms with the passage of time, one hardly notices that one's mind is blown away."

9680,2,"Even these stories of just seven children sometimes seem too much, when in reality they are not enough."
9681,3,Food of Love is an elegant work that is as consistently captivating as it is insightful.
9682,2,"The real question this film raises is not, ""Who?"""
9683,3,"What enlivens this film, beyond the astute direction of Cardoso and the beautifully detailed performances of all the actors, is a note of resistance to social dictates."
9684,0,"Cox offers many insights into existing photos, but there are no films by Nijinsky, so the director treats us instead to an aimless hodgepodge."

9686,0,A bleak film.
9687,1,"The author's admirers will probably find it fascinating, others perhaps baffling."
9688,3,"Reign of Fire is hardly the most original fantasy film ever made - apart from Road Warrior, it owes aliens and every previous dragon drama enormous debt - but that doesn't make it any less entertaining."

9695,2,"For a debut film, Skin of Man, Heart of Beast, it feels unusually safe."
9696,2,"Although it is a melodrama, the filmmaker tackles this natural grain and produces a work that is more interested in asking questions than answering them."
9697,1,"A ""Home Alone"" movie that's staged like ""Rosemary's Baby,"" but not as well thought out as any of those movies."
9698,3,"The pain, loneliness and insecurity of the scripting process are brought vividly and painfully to life in this self-deprecating, snappy and funny feature by Charlie Kaufman and his twin brother Donald, directed by Spike Jonze."

9839,1,Trying to make a head or end of story in the hip-hop indie snipes is enough to strain the brain - and the benefits are negligible.
9840,4,"It rips along with B-movie verve while adding the rich details and playing broke, which heralds something special."

9848,4,"Mr. Caine and Mr. Fraser are here the whole show, with their memorable and imaginative performances."
9849,2,"The inevitable double and triple crosses ensue, but the only drama is hearing John Malkovich's giant consigliere utter his next line."

9853,0,"This is the kind of film where you want to bang your head on the seat in front of you, on your ignorance, on your idiocy, on your completely inappropriate seriousness."
9854,3,"But as in the 1920s, travelling there is a lot of fun."
9855,4,This film is worthy of recognition.

9857,1,"The cinematic equivalent of patronising a bar favoured by pretentious, untalented artists who like to whine about their cruel fate."

9859,2,"Charming, if overly complicated..."
9860,4,"Well played, well staged and, for all its whimsy, not too pretentious."

9864,1,"But she has the ambition to say something about her subjects, but not the will."

9867,4,"... when the true effect of the day unfolds, the power of this film is undeniable."

9874,4,"Offers the kind of ""laughter therapy"" I need from film comedies - offbeat humour, amusing characters and a happy ending."
9875,0,It may scare you that you have wasted almost two hours of your own precious life with this silly little puddle of a movie.
9876,2,"While the new film is much more flashy than its blood-soaked predecessor, the new screenplay by the returning David S. Goyer is much sillier."
9877,2,There is no clear picture of who killed Bob Crane.
9878,2,Red Dragon is less baroque and ostentatious than Hannibal and less emotionally moving than Silence.

9886,2,When the heroes were actually under 40?
9887,2,"Parker should be commended for adopting a new approach to familiar material, but his determination to remain faithful to the original text leads him to strike a somewhat mannered tone... which ultimately mitigates the human tragedy at the heart of the story."

9905,1,Animated drizzle is supposed to improve the self-image of drooling idiots.
9906,1,"Simplistic, silly and boring."
9907,4,A poignant and solidly entertaining comedy that aims to strengthen the reputation of director and co-writer Juan José Campanella in the United States.
9908,3,Sharp edges and a deep vein of sadness permeate his otherwise comic narrative.
9909,1,His impressive images of chimney fires in the crematorium and piles of corpses are undermined by the film's over-staged portrayal.
9910,1,"A film you see, not one you enter."

9912,4,"Swimming is all about the face of a young woman, and when you cast an actress whose face projects that woman's doubts and aspirations, you succeed."
9913,3,"Since the film lacks dynamics and its position remains largely unclear, the director's experiment is successful."
9914,1,Every note sounds wrong.
9915,3,"Despite modest ambitions, his occasional charms are undeniable."
9916,3,"It's about irrational, inexplicable life, and it seems so real because it doesn't try to filter out the complexity."
9917,3,"Most thrillers send audiences out to talk about certain scary scenes or shocking moments; ""Frailty"" leaves us with the frightening message that true horror may be waiting for us at home."
9918,1,"A standard police drama that, without De Niro's involvement, would probably have resulted in a TNT original."

9921,2,Revealing the way we deceive ourselves is the real strength of One Stour Photo.
9922,4,"What makes Salton Sea surprisingly compelling is that Caruso takes an atypically hypnotic approach to a world that is often handled in a fast-paced, embellished manner."
9923,1,A film that doesn't get enough distance from Leroy's delusions to escape their influence.
9924,3,... pretty good at delivering some good old-fashioned spooky stories.
9925,1,"The film is not painfully bad, something that one can ""fully experience""; it is only painfully bad, something that one forgets completely."
9926,4,Mike Leigh populates his film with a wonderful ensemble cast of characters who bring the everyday struggles of the working class to life
9927,1,"The film spends more time with Schneider than with newcomer McAdams, though her performance is more interesting - LRB- and funnier - RRB- than his."

9929,1,"On the book market, the film ""The Child Remains in the Picture"" would be a shortened edition"
9930,2,"A minor work, but the power of Miller's strange, fleeting concoction of hopeful persistence and hopeless conclusion is undeniable."

9941,1,"Where their heads were, one can only guess."
9942,3,"Director Tom Dey showed a knack for mixing action and idiosyncratic humor in his charming 2000 debut Shanghai Noon, but Showtime's uninspired spread of TV cop-show clichés leaves him mostly empty-handed."
9943,3,Certainly the big finish wasn't something Galinsky and Hawley could have planned... but being a good documentary filmmaker is part of being there when the rope breaks.
9944,4,Speaks eloquently about the symbiotic relationship between art and life.
9945,2,"It is hard to be a black man in America, especially when the man has taken away your car, your working hours and your health insurance."

9949,3,"Like Nadia, a Russian mail-order bride who comes to America and doesn't speak a word of English, Kidman holds the film together with a highly cheesy performance that gradually piles up more layers."
9950,4,The film is a treasure trove of delicacies.
9951,2,"... if you're in the mood for a funny - but bad - movie, you might want to catch freaks as a matinee."
9952,3,Beautifully staged and convincingly performed.
9953,1,"But how it turned out, in spite of all that, is the project's main secret."
9954,1,"""Lilo & Stitch"" never reaches the emotion or timelessness of Disney's great past, or even recent successes like ""Mulan"" or ""Tarzan."" """
9955,1,What Rifkin's LRB-RRB story of the precarious dignity of the slingshot series achieves is marginalized by predictable conspiracies and tedious histrionics.
9956,2,Steers has an unexpectedly stubborn streak of warm-blooded empathy for all his disparate Manhattan residents - especially the a * * * holes.
9957,3,"What remains, even after the most terrible deeds, is an overwhelming sadness that feels as if it has made its way into the bloodstream."
9958,0,"If we beat the protagonist Genevieve LePlouff because she is French, do we have the same opportunity to beat her creators because they are clueless and incapable?"
9959,4,"Full of honest performances and extraordinary details, Baran is a gentle film with dramatic depth, a haunting ode to humanity."
9960,2,That's exactly what you'd expect.
9961,2,"Oh, the travails of big city life!"
9962,3,Steadfast but powerfully dramatic.
9963,2,"... the same tired old gags, modernized for the extreme sports generation."
9964,3,"Though equally solipsistic in tone, the film has enough vitality to justify the notion of making a film version of Evans's Hollywood excess saga."
9965,1,Trivial road-and-buddy picture.
9966,3,"You don't want to live in the city center, but it's a hilarious place to visit."
9967,3,"That ""Alabama,"" despite its predictability and occasional slowness, manages to be enjoyable is primarily due to the cheekiness of Witherspoon -LRB-, who is always a joy to watch even when her material is not top notch -RRB-..."
9968,1,That's because relatively nothing happens.
9969,0,The rest of the movie... is dudsville.
9970,1,Knockaround Guys is set like a student film about two boys who desperately want to be Quentin Tarantino in adulthood.
9971,4,"Intensely romantic, thought-provoking and even a captivating puzzle."
9972,1,A film that loses sight of its own history.
9973,4,"Amid the new populist comedies that emphasize the importance of family tradition and community, it would be hard to find a movie with a bigger, thicker heart than Barbershop."
9974,4,"Sillier, sweeter and shorter than the first -LRB- as well as I remember -RRB-, but still a very good time in the cinema."
9975,1,"The sound is as versatile as the cinematography, in which Schaeffer's film never settles into the light-footed enchantment that the material needs, and the quirks and quirks of the characters never lose their charm."
9976,0,What is missing from murder by numbers is a real psychological basis for the deviant behaviour of the teenagers.
9977,3,"... consistently amusing, sometimes endearing and often fabulous, with a solid cast, remarkable characters, delicious dialogue and a wide range of effective gags."
9978,4,"It's a wonderful, sobering, heartfelt drama."
9979,1,"Trailer-trash-cinema so uncool that only the ""Gadzooks!"" are missing."
9980,2,"Death on another day is only occasionally entertaining, but it's hard not to get excited about its charms, or maybe it's just impossible not to feel nostalgia for movies you grew up with."
9981,3,Sorvino is delightful in the central role.
9982,2,"In the end, it's all about gorgeous costumes, eye-catching large-scale production design and Jeanne's crazy decision to stand by her husband, no matter how many times he demonstrates that he's a disloyal satyr."
9983,3,... the plot weaves us into a complex web.
9984,4,Pretty much the safest bet for an all-round good time at the cinema this summer.
9985,3,"Whenever it threatens to get lost in serious dramaturgy, a rousing sequence of images awakens us, like a wave through swirling rapids or a jump from peak to peak."
9986,0,The film resolutely avoids all the comical possibilities of its situation and becomes another silly high school comedy about sex gags and prom dates.
9987,3,"For all its dark tricks, Secretary is an ingenious romance that maintains a surprisingly lively tone throughout, despite the authors ""occasional digressions into pop Freudianism."
9988,1,"Even in the summer, the most troubled young audience deserves the dignity of an action hero motivated by more than franchise possibilities."
9989,3,An exuberant Tunisian film about the amazing transformation of a tradition-bound widow who is drawn into the exotic world of belly dancing.
9990,4,"Bloody Sunday has the grace to call for prevention rather than blame, making it one of the best war films of all time."
9991,3,"""Film lovers can't help but love Cinema Paradiso, whether it's the original version or the new director's cut."""
9992,2,"Sneak out in style, even if Nakata has done better."
9993,4,It's always exciting.
9994,2,The same should apply to cinemas.
9995,4,"Almodovar is an imaginative teacher of emotional intelligence in this compelling film about two men who discover what William James once called ""the gift of tears."""
9996,4,"It's a glorious spectacle, as D.W. Griffith did in the early days of silent movies."
9997,2,"Like an episode of MTV's Undressed, with 20-fold creativity, but without more substance... entertaining, but could and should have gone deeper."
9998,4,The film's constant melancholy and calm narrative are masterfully controlled.
9999,1,Clumsy soap opera disguised as a feature film.
10000,1,The milieu is absolutely unconvincing... and the histrionics reach a really annoying pitch.
10001,3,A delightful little film that revels in its own simplicity. Mostly Martha will leave you with a smile on your face and a growl in your stomach.
10002,1,"As underwater ghost stories make the rounds, Below casts his spooky net into the Atlantic and spews it back, grimly and charred, somewhere northwest of the Bermuda Triangle."
10003,3,"A hypnotic portrait of this sad, compulsive life."
10004,1,"Takes a clunky approach to television to describe a chapter in the life of the famous Irish playwright, poet and drinker."
10005,3,There have been a number of ensemble romances lately... but Peter Mattei's Love in the Time of Money stands out by forming a relationship chain that ends on a positive - LRB- if tragic - RRB- note.
10006,2,"Boring and mechanical, kind of like a very stupid museum exposition"
10007,3,"Shyamalan takes a potentially banal and overused concept - LRB aliens are coming to Earth -RRB- and inserts it into a rustic, realistic and altogether creepy story of a hidden invasion."
10008,2,"Possession, after all, is an honourable, interesting failure."
10009,3,"Highlighted by a pithy style and a superb cast, it's better than you'd expect when you look at the list of films starring Ice-T in a leading role."
10010,1,"At some point, this visual trick stops being clever and turns into shrill, vaguely silly overkill."
10011,3,And educational!
10012,3,"The exploitative, clumsily staged violence overshadows everything, even most actors."
10013,4,"This documentary is a dazzling, remarkably unpretentious reminder of what -LRB- Evans -RRB- had, lost and got back."
10014,4,"Paxton, making his feature film debut, does a strong, measured job with an admirably bleak first screenplay by Brent Hanley."
10015,1,A disappointment for a film that should have been the ultimate IMAX journey.
10016,3,"Although some viewers will not be able to digest so much tongue-in-cheek quirkiness, those who do will have found a cult favorite to enjoy for a lifetime."
10017,1,"Allegedly ""Based on true events,"" ""a distortion of language suggesting that it is impossible to claim it is based on a true story"" ""with a straight face."
10018,3,Offers an interesting look at the rapidly changing face of Beijing.
10019,2,"It's a 100-year-old mystery that Elizabeth Hurley, wearing a swimsuit, keeps interrupting."
10020,1,Barney throws away the goodwill generated by the first half of his film by orchestrating a finale that is impenetrable and dull.
10021,1,But it is hardly a necessary undertaking.
10022,1,"Time stands still more than in Clockstoppers, a sci-fi thriller as lazy as it is endless."
10023,3,"This is historical filmmaking without the balm of right-wing, liberal or conservative ideology."
10024,3,And there's no way you can't talk about the film as soon as you leave the theater.
10025,3,"While the directors Dean Deblois and Chris Sanders dutifully pull the strings, they bravely continue to mix things up."
10026,0,Virtually every attempt at humour is here.
10027,3,"The Bourne Identity shouldn't be half as entertaining as it is, but director Doug Liman and his colleagues have managed to pack it in with enough action to satisfy Boom Bam audiences without sacrificing much character and mood."
10028,0,"Spreads too thinly, so that these actors, as well as the members of the community, do not have profound characteristics."
10029,1,David Spade as Citizen Kane?
10030,1,"Blue Crush follows this formula, but raises too many conflicts to keep the story compelling."
10031,1,"Entertaining enough, but nothing new"
10032,4,"It sums up what it actually means to face your fears, to be a girl in a world of boys, to be a boy who is really in love with a girl, and to ride the great metaphorical wave that life is - wherever it takes you."
10033,1,"The ""Project Greenlight"" winner's debut attempt is sloppy and amateurish."
10034,2,Sitting on the last reel -LRB- Spoiler alarm! -RRB-
10035,1,"A mysterious subplot about drug smuggling within Danish cows falls flat, and if you want to change the end of the Bard, you'd better have a good alternative."
10036,3,"Unlike most anime, whose most ardent fans outside Japan seem to be introverted young men with fantasy fetishes, Metropolis never seems hopelessly youthful."
10037,2,"There is one sure way to get an Oscar nomination for best foreign film: make a film about quirky people who learn an unchallenging, life-affirming lesson while strolling through a strange city with stunning architecture."
10038,3,-LRB- Reno -RRB- delivers a monologue that manages to include both the horror and absurdity of the situation in a balanced way.
10039,2,"A subtle, poignant image of good that is flawed, compromised and sad."
10040,3,But the fact that they are doing so is food for thought.
10041,3,His spirit of iconoclasm - in whatever form - makes for unexpectedly dizzying viewing.
10042,1,"Stress ""stupid."""
10043,1,The problem is that the film has no idea whether it's serious or not.
10044,3,An elegant film with often surprising twists and a mixture of naivety and sophistication.
10045,4,"You can't enter the pantheon of the best swashbucklers, but it's a lot of fun and you get to see one of the best actors in the world, Daniel Auteuil, having a good time."
10046,4,"The delicious accompaniment... comes early and stays late and fills almost every minute... with a carefree glow, a few cheeky giggles and a glorious dose of humanity's liberating ability to triumph over one or the other Scrooge."
10047,1,"Contains the humour, characterisation, emotion and intelligence of a bad sitcom."
10048,0,I have returned from the afterlife to warn you: this film is 90 minutes long and life is too short.
10049,3,"Shyamalan offers an abundance of clues along the way - innumerable signs, if you will - that beneath the familiar, funny surface there is a much bigger, much more significant story than one in which little green men come to earth for harvest."
10050,1,"Shatner is probably the funniest person in the movie, which gives you an idea of how bad it was."
10051,3,"It celebrates the playful spark of the group's nonconformity and looks back vividly on what Hibiscus grandly called his ""angels of light."""
10052,1,"Virtually follows the original film scene by scene and yet manages to empty it almost completely of humour, verve and fun."
10053,3,"Rarely has the skin looked so beautiful, desirable, even delicious as in ""Trouble Every Day."""
10054,3,"If the plot seems a little thin, it's because Panic Room isn't interested in anything other than sucking you in... and making you sweat."
10055,3,The really appealing thing about the characters is their resemblance to ordinary children.
10056,3,"There are times when the film's reach exceeds its reach, but the production works more often than it doesn't."
10057,1,"Perhaps a better celebration of these unjustly dismissed heroes would be a film that is not so painfully forced, false and invented."
10058,4,The slam-bang superheroes are kinetic enough to captivate even the antsy youngsters.
10059,0,Underrehearsed and lifeless
10060,4,"Bittersweet comedy full of life, hand gestures and some really charming Italian guys."
10061,1,"Appropriately for this time of year, I assign a shining star to Roberto Benigni's Pinocchio - but guarantee that no wise men will follow him."
10062,0,One of the most unpleasant things the studio has ever produced.
10063,4,Much more pleasant than its predecessor.
10064,2,An R-rated road trip version of Mama's Family.

10067,1,"Noyce's biggest mistake is to think we needed rousing, dramatic Hollywood moments to keep us going."
10068,3,"It seems impossible that an epic four-hour Indian musical about a game of cricket could be so good, but it is."
10069,3,Much smarter and more attentive than it sounds at first.
10070,4,"The young Hanks and Fisk, who look vaguely like their celebrity parents, bring a fresh look and ease to work in front of the camera."
10071,3,"It's good, edgy stuff, violent and a bit exploitative, but also beautifully made, morally awake and clever on the street."
10072,1,The power skirmishes between victims and robbers become entrenched in an undifferentiated rhythm of artificial tension.
10073,0,"Becomes a bit of a mish-mash: a tear-jerker that doesn't do it, and a thriller that doesn't."
10074,2,The power of this script and the performances that go with it is that the whole damn thing has not lifted our moral shackles.
10075,1,It's practically impossible to like these despicable characters.
10076,1,Too long and adoring bio-doctoral thesis.
10077,0,Shankman... and screenwriter Karen Janszen meander through the narrative as if it were a series of biblical parables and not an actual story.
10078,0,A devastating indictment of rampant greed and unbridled materialism.
10079,0,There's certainly something wrong with a comedy that just laughs at the choice of outtakes in the credits.
10080,2,"It's a drawing, chattering, lovable follow-up to a film, a Southern Gothic with the emotional arc of its rough blues soundtrack."
10081,1,"Funny, pointless, tasteless and idiotic."
10082,3,A gift for all those who love both dance and cinema
10083,1,"Too much power, too little breath."
10084,1,"Windtalkers, who throw in everything except someone pulling the needle out of a grenade with their teeth, seem to have scoured every old WWII film for all-too-familiar material."

10087,3,What a great way to spend 4 units of the day.

10089,0,But one thing is certain: It never comes close to being funny or scary.
10090,4,"Return to Never Land is a reliable, regular Disney cartoon with enough creative energy and wit to entertain all ages."

11351,2,"Maid in Manhattan may not look so attractive at the third or fourth look at the street... But as a high-concept vehicle for two bright stars of the moment who can meet the high expectations of the fans, the film passes the inspection."
