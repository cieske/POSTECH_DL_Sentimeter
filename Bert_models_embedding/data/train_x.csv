6194,Not only reminder of how they used to make movies but also how they sometimes still can be made 
6195,Like mediumgrade network sitcom mostly inoffensive fitfully amusing but ultimately so weightless that decent draft in the auditorium might blow it off the screen 
6196,Indeed none of these words really gets at the very special type of badness that is Deuces Wild 
6197,Plays like bad blend of an overripe episode of TV Dawson Creek and recycled and dumbeddown version of Love Story

6212,The movie messages are quite admirable but the story is just too clichd and too often strains credulity

6241,All of it works smoothly under the direction of Spielberg who does convincing impersonation here of director enjoying himself immensely 
6242,It no lie Big Fat Liar is real charmer 
6243,This is the kind of movie where the big scene is man shot out of cannon into vat of ice cream 
6244,This is DiCaprio best performance in anything ever and easily the most watchable film of the year

6261, It painful to watch Witherspoon talents wasting away inside unnecessary films like Legally Blonde and Sweet Home Abomination mean Alabama

6269,Now he makes them 
6270,The town has kind of an authentic feel but each one of these people stand out and everybody else is in the background and it just seems manufactured to me and artificial

6272,Sewer rats could watch this movie and be so skeeved out that they need shower 
6273,Its metaphors are opaque enough to avoid didacticism and the film succeeds as an emotionally accessible almost mystical work 
6274,It follows the basic plot trajectory of nearly every Schwarzenegger film Someone crosses Arnie

6309,Directorchef Gabriele Muccino keeps it fast zippy comin at ya as if fearing that his film is molto superficiale

6317,It is there to give them good time 
6318,A Bmovie you can sit through enjoy on certain level and then forget

10593, Cage manages degree of casual realism
10594,Mr Clooney Mr Kaufman and all their collaborators are entitled to take deep bow for fashioning an engrossing entertainment out of an almost surefire prescription for critical and commercial disaster

10615,It the kind of underinspired overblown enterprise that gives Hollywood sequels bad name

10641,Most fish stories are little peculiar but this is one that should be thrown back in the river 
10642,It follows the Blair Witch formula for an hour in which we re told something creepy and vague is in the works and then it goes awry in the final minutes 
10643,A battle between bugeye theatre and deadeye matinee 
10644,Moves in such odd plot directions and descends into such messagemongering moralism that its good qualities are obscured 
10645,The featurelength stretch strains the show concept 
10646,Romanek keeps adding flourishes artsy fantasy sequences that simply feel wrong

10658,A 
10659,Even the hastily and amateurishly drawn animation can not engage 
10660,Starts promisingly but disintegrates into dreary humorless soap opera 
10661,An incredibly irritating comedy about thoroughly vacuous people manages to embody the worst excesses of nouvelle vague without any of its sense of fun or energy 
10662,Like most of Jaglom films some of it is honestly affecting but more of it seems contrived and secondhand 
10663,Jones helps breathe some life into the insubstantial plot but even he is overwhelmed by predictability 
10664,The thing just never gets off the ground 
10665,A quiet disquieting triumph 
10666,Like grinning Jack Lantern its apparent glee is derived from lobotomy having had all its vital essence scooped out and discarded 
10667,What sets it apart is the vision that Taymor the avant garde director of Broadway The Lion King and the film Titus brings 
10668,Is not so much work of entertainment as it is unique wellcrafted psychological study of grief 
10669,Memorable for peculiar malaise that renders its tension flaccid and by extension its surprises limp and its resolutions ritual 
10670,Slap her she not funny 
10671,The cast is topnotch and predict there will be plenty of female audience members drooling over Michael Idemoto as Michael 
10672,Forget the Psychology study of romantic obsession and just watch the procession of costumes in castles and this wo nt seem like such bore 
10673,But there plenty to offend everyone 
10674,A pretty funny movie with most of the humor coming as before from the incongruous but chemically perfect teaming of Crystal and De Niro 
10675,an Bruin Where Art Thou 
10676,LRB RRB slummer 
10677,Authentic and at times endearing humorous spooky educational but at other times as bland as block of snow 
10678,That such horrible movie could have sprung from such great one is one of the year worst cinematic tragedies 
10679,The path Ice Age follows most closely though is the one established by Warner Bros giant Chuck Jones who died matter of weeks before the movie release 
10680,A smart steamy mix of road movie comingofage story and political satire 
10681,even after minutes of playing opposite each other Bullock and Grant still look ill at ease sharing the same scene 
10682,Though uniformly well acted especially by young Ballesta and Galan LRB firsttime actor RRB writerdirector Achero Manas film is schematic and obvious 
10683,Proof of this is Ballistic Ecks vs Sever 
10684,Let face it there are nt many reasons anyone would want to see Crossroads if they re not big fans of teen pop kitten Britney Spears 
10685,LRB The Cockettes RRB provides window into subculture hellbent on expressing itself in every way imaginable 
10686,A fanciful drama about Napoleon last years and his surprising discovery of love and humility 
10687,More vaudeville show than wellconstructed narrative but on those terms it inoffensive and actually rather sweet 
10688,Enough may pander to our basest desires for payback but unlike many revenge fantasies it ultimately delivers 
10689,Trying to figure out the rules of the Country Bear universe when are bears bears and when are they like humans only hairier would tax Einstein brain

10691,If you ve grown tired of going where no man has gone before but several movies have take heart 
10692,Rifkin references are impeccable throughout 
10693,You really have to salute writerdirector Haneke LRB he adapted Elfriede Jelinek novel RRB for making film that is nt nearly as graphic but much more powerful brutally shocking and difficult to watch 
10694,Even when Crush departs from the formula it feels like glossy rehash 
10695,You could love Safe Conduct LRB Laissez Passer RRB for being subtitled French movie that is minutes long 
10696,Unfunny comedy with lot of static set ups not much camera movement and most of the scenes take place indoors in formal settings with motionless characters 
10697,In the end there is nt much to it 
10698,Too much of Storytelling moves away from Solondz social critique casting its audience as that of intellectual lector in contemplation of the auteur professional injuries 
10699,Fifty years after the fact the world political situation seems little different and LRB director Phillip RRB Noyce brings out the allegory with remarkable skill 
10700,It a masterpeice

10908,Whether Quitting will prove absorbing to American audiences is debatable
